## ðŸ’¡ About the Project

This fully functional app serves as an example of how to create an Android application utilising Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture methodology.

By bringing Clean Architecture concepts to Android, this repository aims to continue the Clean Architecture movement. It is important to note that the goal is to utilise the characteristics of the Kotlin programming language as well as to draw inspiration from other intriguing methodologies, such as functional programming, and to learn from their successes and failures.
The trick of the project is to demonstrate best practices, provide a set of guidelines, and present modern Android Application Architecture that is modular, scalable, maintainable and testable, suitable for bigger teams and long application lifecycle management.

## ðŸ’¡ API:

To retrieve the top headlines for a specified source, this application will use NewsApi (BBC news).ðŸ‘‡
https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=bbc-news&apiKey=$API_KEY ðŸ”¥

## Features ðŸ‘“

- [x] Built On JetPack Compose (News API)
- [x] Biometric authentication
- [x] Fetch blogs from NewsApi
- [x] Tests (mocks and fakes).

## Constraints fulfilled :

â€¢ The app is written in Kotlin.
â€¢ The app is targeting latest android version platform 33.
â€¢ The app must is built using Android Studio 3.0+.
â€¢ The app supports both portrait and landscape modes without crashing at any time.
â€¢ The app is using using Retrofit2+ for HTTP/REST and GSON for JSON.
â€¢ The app includes unit tests

## Story 1: When the user launches the application, he should land in a screen where is possible to see top headlines for the specific news source

### Criteria Fulfilled:

â€¢ News provider name should be showed as a screen title 2. Headlines are presented in a list format. âœ…
â€¢ Each cell should present the headline title âœ…
â€¢ Headlines must be sorted by date âœ…
â€¢ The user must be able to scroll through the list of headlines âœ…
Each cell should present headline image, if available (download and cache it, donâ€™t
bundle it) âœ…

## Story 2: When the user taps on a headline, he should be taken to a new screen

### Criteria Fulfilled:

â€¢ Tapping on a headline presents a new screen. âœ…
â€¢ Image, title, description and content should be displayed, if available âœ…

## Bonus Story 3: When user opens the application, it should ask for a fingerprint identification, if available

### Criteria Fulfilled:

â€¢ If the device has a fingerprint scanner and itâ€™s configured in the device, user should be required to use it when he opens the application âœ…
â€¢ If the device doesnâ€™t have fingerprint scanner or itâ€™s not configured, then it should open normally âœ…

## Bonus Story 4: A new flavor should be created to present news for another source

### Acceptance criteria:**

â€¢ User should land in a different news source if running another target âœ…
â€¢ Headlines should be presented according to the target that was selected âœ…

## Product Flavors

There are two flavors that present news for different-different sources. CNN and BBC.


    productFlavors {
        bbcNews {
            // Assigns this product flavor to the "version" flavor dimension.
            // If you are using only one dimension, this property is optional,
            // and the plugin automatically assigns all the module's flavors to
            // that dimension.
            dimension "version"
            applicationIdSuffix ".bbc"
            versionNameSuffix "-bbc"
            buildConfigField "String", "SOURCE", "\"bbc-news\""
            buildConfigField "String", "APP_NAME", "\"BBC News\""
        }
        cnnNews {
            dimension "version"
            applicationIdSuffix ".cnn"
            versionNameSuffix "-cnn"
            buildConfigField "String", "SOURCE", "\"cnn\""
            buildConfigField "String", "APP_NAME", "\"CNN News\""

        }
    }
